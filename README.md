 *  Hi peeps, I'm 88sullenstars. I am totally new to the world of coding & programming.  * 
 *  I'm taking baby steps to learn how to program, and use of all of the amazing tools   *
 *  that are available. I am beyond excited, but I am also very nervous about the whole  *
 *  thing. To be perfectly honest, I am not too fluent with computers... Still, I am     *
 *  going to give it all I've got and try my very, very best to learn as much as I can.  *
 *  Yay! I sure hope that I am not an epic failure at this :)                            *
