# hello-world
my first repository
Hi, I'm 88sullenstars. I am new to the world of coding. I am taking baby steps into learning how to code and make use of all of the amazinfg tools that are available. I am beyond excited, but I am also very nervous that I may get things wrong. To be perfectly honest, I am not very computer literate, but I am trying my very, very best in trying to learn as much as I possibly can. Yay! I sure hope that I am not an epic failure at this :)
